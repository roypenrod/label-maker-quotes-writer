# label-maker-quotes-writer
This is a JavaScript animation project I created to learn more about how to work with JS and jQuery.  

The animation simulates a label maker typing out a quote, erasing it, and typing out another quote.

I'm posting this as a portfolio sample for potential employers.

The source code works, but it wasn't designed to be user-friendly for anyone else.  Use at your own risk.

I created the project using jQuery v1.11.3.
